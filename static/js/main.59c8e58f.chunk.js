After graduating from there, I became a contractor at that company helping students and building internal tools. After that ended, I started my first job at a tech company. \n\nTo say I was unprepared is an understatement. All of the above happened within a single year. In one year I left behind my collegiate education and my family to move to Texas to start work as a software engineer. I was thriving in my position, but also drowning. Kind of like finishing a marathon while you're on fire. I'm going to write down some really important things I think bootcampers should know when they're entering the tech field that aren't really taught in bootcamps.\n\n## O Google, My Google\nPeople joke about googling being half of a dev's job, but it's really about being _efficient_ at it. Know when you're reading a good source vs. some one-off medium post (or a blog post like this!). One person's opinion on stack overflow is not the best solution, and yes, I have had someone justify their work to me by linking one person's comment on a stack overflow solution.\n\nGet comfortable with asking questions, but make sure you're asking _good_ questions. Be as specific as you can. Include screenshots, errors, and what you want your end result to be. Make sure you always try solving things yourself before asking for help, but don't get into a timesink. It doesn't matter if you solved a bug yourself if it took six hours. The benefit of asking questions is it's often one of the best ways to learn on the job.\n\n## Tech Culture and Disconnecting\nFind communities and friendships, but don't make your entire life tech. That's a one-way ticket to burnout, especially on twitter/other social media apps where it's easy to surround yourself with your work. Remove the term \"work hard, play hard\" from your mind. Set boundaries. Limit (work) screen time. Snooze slack from 5-9, or outside whatever your work horus are. By the time you realize you've burnt out, it's often too late.\n\n## Work Outside the Keyboard\nSoftware development cycles are just as important as coding skills. Learn about AGILE or waterfall. Learn which stragegy works better for different teams or different projects. Don't tie yourself to one.\n\nQA is love, QA is life. Learn about working with QA and about how the QA process works. Learn about automation and regression testing. Be a QA for a day on some open source project's PR. QA is pivotal at any company, whether you have a dedicated team or the _dev_ is the QA.\n\n## Sending the Code\nLearn about the different types of releasing for platforms. For example, mobile apps have to submit through the app store, but a mobile site that looks/feels like an app can release as fast as you need it to. Familiarize yourself with the fees apps have to pay Apple and Google to use the store. What about the process of release? What are the ways code can get to production? What the hell even IS staging?\n\n## Other Skills\nLearn git and version history. Get comfortable with the command line. It's easy to default to version control in VSC, but being able to use your terminal will benefit you in the long rung. Learn about merging (easy), rebasing (not as easy), and bisecting (both a blessing and a curse).\n\nYou might not be working with kubernetes and docker, but do you know what they are? What are the benefits of moving to the cloud? What can that mean for a large company? What about web accessibility? How does that work? Have you ever used a screenreader or keyboard navigation? These are all things to read up a bit about. Don't try to be an expert on everything, but having your fingers in a few pies never hurts.\n\n## The Sad Stuff\nWhen you get started in the tech industry as someone without a formal computer science degree, you will be judged. Your opinion will be seen as lesser. And if you're a woman or minority, it's only worse. This is getting more motivational than I wanted, but your success really comes down to knowing yourself. You ARE a developer. You ARE good at what you do. If people don't, can't, or won't see that, it's not your problem. Ignore them. Stay in your lane, unbothered, moisturized, happy, focused, flourishing.\n",desc:"I entered the tech field after completing a bootcamp. I had NO clue what I was getting into.
