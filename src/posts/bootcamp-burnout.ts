# Bootcamp Burnout

When I my first full-time dev position, I was young developer with no formal STEM education, thrown from working on small, internal tooling at Devmountain to working at a large tech company. This job was my oyster, and I didn't really feel like I could live up to it.

Did I have too many questions? Did I cause too many bugs? Was it frustrating to work with me-- was I learning fast enough? I was plagued with uncertainty. I worked lots of hours. I excelled at my work, but I never felt like it was enough. Review after review, I was told I was doing great, but I always felt I could be doing better. I was always painfully aware of my knowledge gaps. I kept pushing myself. At one point, I was shamed in front of the team for some work, and someone called me "overzealous." I'd made a silly mistake with our internationalization and was a little too direct in matching the designs.  It didn't warrant the comment. The dev who made it apologized after I messaged him about how it wasn't the nicest thing, but it was too late.

That word filled my head. All the work I was putting in, all the effort, all the uncertainty, it had all down to that one word. Overzealous. I think that's the point where it all started going downhill. I kept trying my best-- but my best was too much. Too many hours. Too much investment. I told myself it was something I'd shake off. A rough day turned into a rough week which turned into a rough month which is quickly turning into a rough year. A rose by any other name would smell as burnt.

Any worker can become burnt out. But I believe bootcamp graduates are more succeptible. I'm sure I'm not the only bootcamp graduate who fell into the same trap. It's inevitable that tech teams are going to hire on bootcampers that either feel like they need to prove their worth as a developer or get too invested in the brand new field. How can team leaders catch burn out before it catches their team?

## Understand warning signs
Burnt out. BURNT OUT. Those are the big buzzwords. But there's a mountain of problems that start before that. Mental health is still very stigmatized, so how do you address it? Have biweekly check ins. Your dev may not feel comfortable spilling that, hey, they're going to therapy, or, hey, I'm working from my bed because I don't want to move, but if you can gear your questions to focus on work happiness, you might be surprised at what you here. Does the dev sound disinterested? Are their replies uncharacteristically short? Bootcamp graduates sometimes have a "fake it till you make it" policy, so it's up to you to build repoire and a level of trust with your dev. It takes a lot of strength to say you're not okay, and with the pressure bootcamp grads can be put under, it's even harder.

## Start with understanding
Bootcamp graduates just spent tens of thousands of dollars to get a certification that's still being accepted in the tech community as legitimate experience.. They put in all-nighters and strange hours to get in projects. There's a fear that they're not going to make it in such a fierce market. I've been there, both as a student and a mentor/resource to bootcamp students. These devs are eager for experience, to learn more, to spread their weeks, and there lies the rub. So when you've got that job offer, you want to, of course, dive in. Managers and leads need to begin with that. When hiring a bootcamp graduate, you're going to have to train them not only in your tech stack, but more importantly about work-life balance. That goes beyond the "take a 15 minute break every now and then."

## Be Realistic
Take a brief scroll through your LinkedIn feed and you'll find exactly what *not* to do when a bootcamp graduate (or ANY dev for that matter) gets burnt out. Everyone is going to need their own strategy for burn out, and that's a good thing. Working on solutions specific to each dev is, in the long run, going to save them from future burn out and save yourself from having to hire a replacement for them. Burnt out devs are the most at-risk of leaving your team. Solutions may include a change in pace or workload. Maybe that dev needs a few weeks working on bugs. Maybe they need to check out earlier during the day. Flexibility is the most important thing: it's my personal experience that makes me believe that devs don't *want* to stop working, they're just... burnt out.

Let a dev work flexible hours. Try to minimize meetings. Encourage them to take time for themselves, even if that means being available on slack/skype for questions but otherwise resting. Tell them to go through trainings, to do readings, to step away from code work and look at some stuff they're interested in, even if it's not in the jobn's tech stack.

## Create goals
For a long time my reviews, over and over, were "you're doing great, let's focus on this." And the 'this' would be back-end. Or learning more about testing. Or (I still regret this one), working on team communication while everyone's remote. Once you've acknowledged burnout, I think the next best thing to do is work with your dev to create realistic goals, down to bite-size pieces. "If you want to learn about <insert the cool new tech here>, let's block off an hour every Wednesday and Friday for you to learn." or "What do you think about adding half an hour or so of code review to your morning routine?". Small. Achievable. Meaningful. This is difficult, because all of those words mean different things to everyone. Mixing the "Be Realistic" section with these goals can create breathing room for your dev.

There's no perfect solution to burnout. In an information-dense world shaken by crisis after crisis, it's obvious that everyone is going to have some breaking point. Because of the pressure and drive bootcamp graduates face, they're extra-susceptible to burnout, so they need an approach that encourages growth while not forcibly requiring it. Stay on the lookout. Understand what burnout is and how devs deal with it. Be realistic. Most of all, show grace. We might work with machines, but treating people like them only ends in a failed build.
