# Bootcamp Burnout

I graduated twice in 2017.

The first graduation was from the University of Memphis, in a big, fancy ceremony, with robes, tassels, family, the works. I got a big paper with my name on it. *Mackenzie Clark.* A degree in Asian Studies and International Trade, with a focus in manangement and Chinese culture and communication.

The second graduation was from Devmountain, a bootcamp located in downtown Dallas. Our graduation was in the basement of an apartment building, where the school was. I don't remember if I got a nice paper with my name on it, but I got a certification for my LinkedIn profile.

The differences between those events was unreal. After college, I spent months looking for work and feeling like I'd just made a very expensive four-year-long mistake. When I graduated Devmountain, I had a contractor position with the company, and a full time job offer shortly after that.

When I started that full-time position, I was young developer with no formal STEM education, thrown from working on small, internal tooling at Devmountain to working at a large tech company. Several of my coworkers were the same: we had a self-taught Graphql genius who went on to become an architect for it, a bootcamp graduate who went on to found his own start-up blending his love of teaching and his love for development, and yet another who went from working on our main site to becoming the go-to dev for all of our APAC development. And me, without a STEM degree, with a vague understanding of algorithms, fresh out of a bootcamp with no experience with user-facing websites. This job was my oyster, and I didn't really feel like I could live up to it.

Did I have too many questions? Did I cause too many bugs? Was it frustrating to work with me-- was I learning fast enough? I was plagued with uncertainty. I worked lots of hours. I excelled at my work, but I never felt like it was enough. Review after review, I was told I was doing great, but I always felt I could be doing better. I was always painfully aware of my knowledge gaps. I kept pushing myself. At one point, I was shamed in front of the team for some work, and someone called me "overzealous." I'd made a silly mistake with our internationalization and was a little too direct in matching the designs.  It didn't warrant the comment. The dev who made it apologized after I messaged him about how it wasn't the nicest thing, but it was too late.

That word filled my head. All the work I was putting in, all the effort, all the uncertainty, it had all down to that one word. Overzealous. I think that's the point where it all started going downhill. I kept trying my best-- but my best was too much. Too many hours. Too much investment. I told myself it was something I'd shake off. A rough day turned into a rough week which turned into a rough month which is quickly turning into a rough year. A rose by any other name would smell as burnt.

Any worker can become burnt out. But I believe bootcamp graduates are more succeptible. I'm sure I'm not the only bootcamp graduate who fell into the same trap. It's inevitable that tech teams are going to hire on bootcampers that either feel like they need to prove their worth as a developer or get too invested in the brand new field. How can team leaders catch burn out before it catches their team?

## Be Realistic
